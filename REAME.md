Assumptions
- for security reasons we don´t return all practices if a search is performed with any parameter
- when searching by availability I´ve assumed that if you inform only from you´re looking for practices that are opened at that time and doesn´t matter what time they´re closed.

Security
- to acess the endpoint it would be useful to use some kind of authentication, like JWT

Falta
- Docker
- Readme
